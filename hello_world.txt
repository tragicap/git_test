If nothing matters, then all the pain and guilt you feel for making nothing of your life goes away... sucked into a bagel.
You have so many goals you never finished, dreams you never followed. You're living your worst you.
There is always something to love.
Does it offer you comfort or torment?
He who loves the most regrets the most.

Don't you want to take that leap of faith? Or become an old man, filled with regret, waiting to die alone...
In our perfect little box... we will be together forever. 
And he never doubts that he is loved...



You're waiting for a train. A train that will take you far away. You know where you hope this train will take you, but you can't know for sure.

Yet, it doesn't matter.
Now, tell me why?

Because we'll be together.
